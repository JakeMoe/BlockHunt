### TODO

DONE Title screens for time

DONE Instant damage potion kills both in game and out

DONE No space in message announcing player joined lobby

DONE Clear all effects when leaving game arena

DONE Elimination message shows local player, not player that was eliminated

Keep track of potions, clear at end

We need to customise the Scoreboard whilst people are playing games (I'll probably generate one for you to code off)

Can we have a scoreboard whilst people are waiting in the lobby?

DONE Message in chat (or maybe subtitle?) when players pick up a potion (so we can tell them what effect they have, otherwise they have no idea)

DONE Add a "whitelist" where pumpkins will only spawn on the defined blocks, everything else it will ignore

DONE Potion effect Instant_Damage kills twice

DONE Change the countdown messages from 15 - 0 to:
    - 15
    - 10
    - 5
    - 4
    - 3
    - 2
    - 1

Harming potions are continuous until death
