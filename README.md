## BlockHunt

BlockHunt is a customizable Minecraft minigame where you try to find as many of the specified block in the time provided. The play area is defined by a WorldGuard region.

This is very much a work in progress at the moment.

The original idea comes from Pumpkin Hunt by TylerOG: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pumpkin-hunt.13966/
